# leaflet-challenge

I have recently worked with the United States Geological Survey! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. I have helped the USGS with creating an interactive map using a leaflet. 
This interactive map shows users' recent earthquakes and their strengths. I was able to get data regarding earthquakes from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php.
